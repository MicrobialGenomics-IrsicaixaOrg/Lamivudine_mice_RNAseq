# Lamivudine_mice_RNAseq
This repository contains the Rmd code for reproducing the analysis of transcriptomic data (total bulk RNAseq sequencing) obtained from the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Ts65Dn and WT mice, untreated or treated with lamivudine, in the 'Lamivudine modulates the expression of neurological impairment-related genes and LINE1 retrotransposons in brain tissues of a Down syndrome mouse model' study.
